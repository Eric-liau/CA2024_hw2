## Functions
### abs
This function converts the input value to its absolute value. When the input value is negative, I use 0 minus the input value to implement the absolute value conversion.
### relu
This function converts every element x in input array to max(x,0).
### argmax
This function scans an integer array to find the maximum value and returns the index of its first occurrence. I iterated through the input array, storing the maximum value in 't0' and its index in 't1'. In each iteration, I compared the current value with the maximum value. If the current value was larger, I updated both the maximum value and its index.
### dot
